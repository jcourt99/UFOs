# UFOs
Module 11 - Javascript

## Overview

The purpose of the challenge is to create a webpage about UFO sightings. The webpage has a dynamic table incorporated in it. Users can filter and search for several different criteria, including date, city, state, country and shape of UFO. Javascript and HTML are used to write the code to develop the filters and format the webpage.

## Results

This webpage allows users to search by five different criteria. 
For example, if the user types "ca" in the State filter, all UFO sightings that happened in California will populate on the webpage.

After the table is filtered down to a specific state, then the user can input a city, such as "el cajon":

After the previous 2 filters were entered, the webpage displays five UFO sightings. To narrow the search even further, the user can enter a shape of "triangle":

After the three filters are completed, the webpage displays two UFO sightings.


## Summary

While this design allows the large table of data to be narrowed down via filters, there is not an option to reset the filters. The user must refresh the webpage to clear all filters. This is not ideal. I would recommend adding a "Clear Filters" button to the webpage. 

Another improvement for this webpage would be to allow the user to sort the "Duration" column in ascending or descending order. This enhancement may be beneficial if the user is searching for UFO sightings that lasted several minutes versus just a few minutes.
